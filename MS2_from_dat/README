# Data: The datasets are the csv files generated by ACE_Peptides, indicating significant peptides

# Conditions of peptide selection to pick up the 3 most significant transitions from MS2 spectrum for each peptide:
- for the first 50 more significant peptides 
- pick up the replicate with the highest peptide score (keep the query, modification, protein, parent mass, calculated mass, delta)
- parse the query section from the .dat file (get the spectrum id, time, charge, ions1 table with mass:intensity peaks/pairs)
- split masses and intensities in seperate tables
- feed masses table to assign method 
- pick up the peaks with the 3 highest intensities
